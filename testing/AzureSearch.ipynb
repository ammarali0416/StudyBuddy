As I reviewed my course notes, I realized that the basics of an MBA education were quite simple and could easily be understood by a wider audience. Thousands of Ten-Day MBA readers have proven it! Readers are applying their MBA knowledge every day to their own business situations. Not only useful in the United States, The Ten-Day MBA has been translated into many languages around the world. So many people are curious about business education, including doctors, lawyers, businesspeople,  and aspiring MBAs. This book answers their questions. The Ten-Day MBA really delivers useful information quickly and easily . Current MBA students have written  me that they even use the book to review for exams. Ten-Day MBAs are “walking the walk and talking the talk” of MBAs every business day. Executive mini-MBA programs are designed around the book. It’s proven that this book can work for you. Written for the impatient student, The Ten-Day MBA allows readers to really grasp the fundamentals of an MBA without losing two years’ wages and incur ring a $175,000 debt for tuition and e xpenses. Prospective MBAs can use this book to see if a two-year investment is worth their while; those about to enter business school can get a big head start on the competition; and those of you who cannot ﬁnd the time or the money can get at least $20,000 of MBA education at 99 percent oﬀ the list price.

The Ten-Day MBA summarizes the essentials of a Top Ten MBA educatio n. The mystique and the livelihood of the Top Ten business schools are predicated on making their curriculum appear as unique and comple x as possible. Companies pay thousands of dollars to send their executives to drink from these hallowed fountains of knowledge for a few days. I spent two years of my life not only drinking from the fountain but also bathing and washing my clothes in it. Which schoo ls are included in the Top Ten is a subject of considerable debate, as displayed by the recent rankings shown at the end of this introduction. The Top Ten actually refers to a group of ﬁfteen nationally recognized schools that play musical chairs for Top Ten ranking. They distinguish themselves by long application forms, active alumni networks, long lists of recruiters, and the ability of their graduates to demand and receive outrageous starting salaries. The Top Ten schools requir e of candidates at least two years’ work experien ce befor e admission. Experienced students can enrich class discussions and study groups. A great deal of my learning came from my classmates’ work experiences. The Top Ten schools do not necessarily oﬀer the best teaching, facilities, or curriculum. Reputation plays a great part in their status. A variety of rating books are available that give the “inside” story on those reputations. So many magazines and newspap ers are now publishing rankings because they are among their best-selling issues. According to the 2010 Bloomber g Businessweek  poll, “racking up the highest satisfaction scores from graduates are, in descending order, Virginia, Chicago, MIT, Berkeley, and Harvar d.” The recruiters’ rankings, on the other hand, are Chicago, Pennsylvania, Harvar d, Northwester n, and Michigan.', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ammar\\\\Downloads\\\\Steven A.

To cover the major concepts, I use examples and outlines and summarize wher ever possible. I slice through the long-winded and selfserving academic readings that at times I had to trudge through. This book contains only the pearls of wisdom buried in my thirty -two binders of cases, course materials, and notes, and updated by cur rent MBAs. I have no vested interest in promoting any of the business theories presented in the book. Therefore, this book does not repeat the same idea over the course of two hundr ed pages as many popular business books tend to do. I crystallize the most important concepts in brief passages so you can learn and remember them without losing interest. From my interviews with graduates from Wharton, Harvar d, Northwester n, and other top schools, I learned that all of their programs serve up the same MBA meal.  Only the spices and pr esentations of the business banquets vary . The basics of MBA knowledge fall into nine disciplines.

When MBAs congr egate, we tend to engage in “MBA babble.” Our use of mystical abbreviations like NPV, SPC, and CRM is only a ruse to justif y our lofty salaries and quick promotions. Please do not be intimidated. MBA jargon is easy to learn! As you read this book, you too will begin to think and talk lik e an MBA .

Others call it AIDA, for Attention/Inter est/Desir e/Action. I have read extensively on this topic and have boiled the theories down to ﬁve steps. For any particular product, the buying process can include one or all of the following steps: Awareness  → Information Search  → Evaluate Alternatives  → Purchase  → Evaluate In the instance of a soap purchase, the process would look lik e this: Smell Body → What Should I Use? → Soap → Ask Wife for Advice → Make Trip to the Store → Read Labels → Buy Dial Soap → Bathe → Smell Body for Odor → Buy Dial Soap Next Time The steps of the buying process explained:  Awareness. (Inter est, Problem Recogn ition). “I might need something.” At some point a person will realize a need, like the need to use soap. Advertising may trigger that need.  Prestige products such as design er clothes and fragrance s trigger desir e. They meet emotional needs such as love and group acceptance. Head & Shoulders preys on the fear of a loss of love and group acceptanc e. You need to ask yours elf, “How do consumers become awar e of my product?” “Wher e are my tar gets lik ely to be e xposed to my message?” Information Search. “Sounds good, let me ﬁnd out more about it.” People involved in purchase decisions are confr onted with information from a variety of sources: Consumer R eports,  salespeople, blogs, specialty magazines, family, friends, and local experts.

This includes not only products within a category, but substitutes as well. When confr onted with the high prices of automobiles, a college student may end up buying a motor cycle, a moped, or a bicycle.

Placing positive information wher e your buyers are likely to look is one k ey to mark eting success. At this stage of the buying process the mark eting manager would like to identif y the inﬂuencers  of his target’s buying behavior . In the golf industry the club pro is a key inﬂuencer in the equipment-buying decision of golfers. If you can sell the pr o, you can sell to the club’s members. Distribution is also crucial at the evaluation stage  of the buying process. If a product is not readily available, a comparable substitute may be chosen just for convenience or immediacy of need . Coca-Cola’s and Pepsi’s wide distribution makes it tough for any new cola competitor to ever be any more than a fringe brand.

As the discussion of buyer behavior indicates, diﬀer ent products elicit diﬀer ent purchase behaviors becaus e of their inher ent importance to the buyer and user. If the consumer feels a high level of “risk” in buying a product, then it is consider ed a high-involvement  product. There are several reasons for high-involvement pur chase decisions: High price The need for the pr oduct’s beneﬁt  (e.g., r eliability, as in the case of a pacemak er) The need for the pr oduct’s psychological r ewar d (e.g., status, love) Clothing, cars, and professional services are examples of high-involvement purchases. They are usually higher priced and at times diﬃcult to compar e. Deter mining the diﬀer ences between alternatives makes high-involvement purchases diﬃcult, especially if the buyer is not an expert. Thus, the information search can be quite extensive. When litigating a damage claim, for example, usually there is no second chan ce to take the case to trial. Therefore, the choice of a lawyer is a high-involvement selection. With lowinvolvement  products the decision is simpler . For example, if a cand y bar isn’t tasty, you can always pitch it and buy another one. A helpful matrix below captur es the possible behaviors resulting from the interaction of the levels of involvement and product diﬀer ences.

If the adve rtising creates a value-e xpressive  message about the product or service, then a product can become important. Such messages link values, such as social status and love, instead of promoting physical product attributes to diﬀer entiate the product from the competition. Pepsi tries to link being moder n and youthful with its products by using singers in elaborate commer cials to sell its soda. Change the Importance of Product Beneﬁts.  Products as well as services provide a variety of beneﬁts. If through mark eting action a beneﬁt can be raised to a heightened level of importance, buyers are likely to become more involved. The beer wars of the 1980s made calories an important competitive issue. An overlook ed attribute— calories—made health-conscious drink ers more awar e of their purchasing decisions, and consequently Miller Lite made out like a bandit. In the 2000s it is carbohydrates. In 2012 the “gluten-fr ee” labels on baked goods were attractive to many, even to those with no gluten aller gy. Introduce Important Characteristic to Product.  A mark eter can also tinker with some of the elements of the product itself to distinguish it. When childpr oof caps were introduced on household cleaners, the involvement of parents in this purchase decision was heightened. The ﬁrst products with protection caps stood out on the store shelves. But once all competitors copied the cap, new avenues of diﬀer entiation were needed and the purchase returned to its lowinvolvement status. Truly low-involvement products often are that way because a minimum level of acceptable perfor mance is requir ed. A thumbtack, for example, does not have a diﬃcult job to perfor m.

The PLC concept is important because the process of diﬀusion  or adoption by the population has majo r implications for how a product is mark eted. Each product develops its own unique PLC as it matur es. Understanding the PLC can give you an MBA insight that your competitors may lack. The four generic stages of the PLC and their implic ations for action are: Stage 1: Introduction, “What is it?” Awareness and education are needed. If possible, a trial is important. High advertising costs may be incur red to get the word out. Some vendors opt for an exclusive distribution  of their products in a few select outlets at ﬁrst. Initially companies make frequen t product changes as customers’ needs become known. The ﬁrst buyers are called the innovators,  followed by the early adopters.  They freely take purchase risks because their personalities or pocketbooks allow them to do so. When companies introduce new products, managers must make diﬃcult pricing decisions because there is frequently no basis for comparison. The level of initial prices and proﬁts has great implications regarding the outcome of futur e battles with competitors as well as your ability to perfor m additional resear ch and development (as with products like nanobots, coutur e fashion, and bar efoot running shoes). Stage 2: Growth, “Wher e can I get it?” Educa tion is still important, but at this stage competition is intensiﬁed. The early majority  becom es interested. As more consumers become familiar with a product, they examine the new models to decide which  to buy, not whether  they should buy. When buyers get to the store, they start comparing featur es. To make the product more accessible, marketers often choose a selective distribution  to gain a greater number and variety of outlets.

This helps a company gain the competitive advantage in the next stage of the PLC (e.g., 3D TVs, tablet computers, and e-r eaders). Stage 3: Maturity, “Why this one?”  At this stage  the late majority  of the mass mark et buys. Because people are accustomed to buying the product and the diﬀer ences are few, brand loyalty plays a dominant role. Price competition often becomes heated in stable mark ets because additional mark et share comes directly from your competi tors. The product’s featur es that were so important in the growth stage have become standardized. Because there is less diﬀer entiation on product attributes, advertising is used as a vehicle to diﬀer entiate products. Mark eting managers try to segment their target market as much as possible to meet speciﬁc unmet consumer needs. In matur e mark ets, competitors are ferreting out all possible segm ents. All possible channels of distribution are also consider ed using a mass mark et distribution strategy (e.g., GPS navigators, laptops, compact ﬂour escent bulbs). Stage 4: Decline, “How much?”  As a product ages in its PLC, it is likely that its competitors oﬀer similar products. Even the most timid consumers, the laggar ds, ﬁnd it safe to buy the product at this late stage. (If it does cause cancer, the FDA has usually found out by now.) Consumers turn a deaf ear to advertising because they know that all competing products are the same. At this stage many companies focus their eﬀorts on reducing price if competition remains, or slowly increasing prices if the competitive ﬁeld thins. Trade relations are key to staying on the retail shelf at this point, because without the excitement of novelty, distributors and retailers would rather  allocate space to newer and potentially more proﬁtable products.

The availability of cash and specialized knowledge are such barriers. The pharmaceutical industry, for e xample, is dominated by a few companies.

Because of these barriers, most small companies team up with large ones if they have a promising new drug to peddle. In the online auction mark et, eBay has a huge advantage because of the size of its buyer audienc e, vendor base, and infrastructur e. On the other hand, Google’s Internet search competitors have a lower barrier to entry . Internet searchers can easily switch servic es, and competitors, such as Yahoo! or Bing, can develop new search technologies.

Everyone who touches the merchandise takes a cut, which is called their margin. Participants in the distribution chain are said to “take margin” from the manufact urer. As a manufactur er of a produc t, you do not “give” the channel margin; there is no charity involved. Channel participants in most industries calculate their cut as a mark up on selling price.  Canadian and some U.S. drug ﬁrms use a mark up on cost, but they are the exceptions. The selling price  is not the ultimate retail price, but the price at which one intermediary sells goods to the next intermediary in the chain. The retail price is what a consumer pays. Because of my experienc e in the coﬀee industry, I will use coﬀee retailing to demonstrate the economics of the channels of distribution. At each level of the chain, the intermediary buys the coﬀee from the previous level and takes a margin based on the sales price to the next level. The mar gin is not based on cost. This is how one dollar’s worth of coﬀee beans, in my example, can r each the consumer at a price of six dollars.

If your product is unique and in demand, then the manufactur er generally has the power to outline the terms of the r elationship. If not, the channel’s inter mediaries will be able to dictate the terms to take as much margin as possible. In the grocery trade, the power of the channel has shifted from the manufactur ers to the super mark et chains. As smaller grocery chains consolidated into larger super chains in the 1980s, the larger chains’ management realized that they held the prized real estate, “shelf space.” Each stock keeping unit (SKU) on the shelf takes space. Each product must be track ed, shelve d, and inventoried. When Mazola cooking oil produces three sizes, it takes up three SKUs. With a ﬁnite amount of store and warehouse space, the shelf real estate has become valuable, and retailer s want to be paid for carrying each SKU. Mark eters even diagram their shelves like architects in drawings called planograms  and ﬁght over best placement. Packaged-goods companies, large and small, must often pay slotting fees to the chains to reserve “slots” on their shelves for both new and existing products. In the 1970s the packaged-goods giants could force their product s on the trade. When there were many smaller grocery chains, Procter & Gamble and Kraft Foods could play one chain against another by threatening to withhold their popular products. That is no longer the case. Unfortunately, slotting fees can run into millions of dollars for a new product introduction. Therefore, in practice, slotting fees bar smaller competitors from selling in the super mark et.

In distribution relationships involving manufactur ers’ incentives, the retailer is also obligated.

As with distribution, promotional eﬀorts should be guided by a strategy . Pull strategies are those eﬀorts that pull buyers to the outlets that carry your product. TV pitches that instruct viewers “to ask for Perdue chick en by name at your local grocer” pull consumers to the stores that carry it. Another important mission of promotion is to encourage the distrib ution channels to stock and sell a product to consumers. Such eﬀorts ar e a push  strategy . Beer distributors, for instance, spend a great deal of their time trying to court bar owner s to stock and promote their brew on tap. Most plans have an element of both push and pull strategies. In the beer industry they spend heavily to advertise the brand as well as to gain greater bar distribution.

Two important things to keep in mind are your intended mission and the quantitative measur ement of exposur e required to accomplish it. Please pay attention to the following measur ement vocabulary . This is what you pay for when you buy advertising. The tendency for the uninitiated is to listen to the ad world’s babble, not understand it, and buy their wares anyway . Buying advertising is just like buying mark eting resear ch—know what and why you are buying— buyer bewar e. Reach  and frequency  are key quantitative measur ements of media goals. Reach is the percentage of the target mark et who see and hear your promotion or advertisement. Frequency is the number of times they saw or heard it. Mark eters refer to the number of times a person is exposed to a messa ge as the total impressions  made on that audience. Because of the buying behavior associ ated with diﬀer ent products, diﬀer ent mixes of reach and frequency are requir ed to induce purchase. When multiplied, Reach × Frequency equals a measur e called gross rating points (GRP s). Add the GRPs together and you get total rating points  (TRPs). GRP and TRP are the measur es by which radio, TV, and outdoor advertising is sold and pur chased. The desired demographics and segmentation variables of the audiences deliver ed also enter prominently into the equation.

High GRPs do not guarantee sales. The message deliver ed is also a key deter minant. When advertising people refer to the message, copy (wording), or layout of advertising, they call it the creative,  a noun. Ad agency people who develop the ideas ar e called creatives. Magazine and newspaper  advertising is purchased  based on the size and segmentation variables of their circulations. Magazines have a longer shelf life, but newspapers deliver a much more immediate and focused geographic readership, which is best for sale promotions. Both of these print audiences are bought on a cost per thousand  (CPM) readers basis. A compr ehensive listing of media and mailing list prices is provided by SRDS (Standar d Rate & Data Service) online or in a series of telephone-book-sized volumes. A competitive measur e of media is share of voice.  Using this measur e, an advertiser can target a certain percentage of media spending by all competitors within a product category . Advertisers believe that to have an impact thr ough the competitive media clutter  and noise, the relative spending level is just as important as the absolute dollars spent. Through the clutter, it would have been futile to run a TV ad to promote the tiny coﬀee brand that I managed during my summer internship. A small competitor had no chance against the likes of Procter & Gamble, Kraft Foods, and Nestlé, who together spend millions. Any aﬀordable ad would have been dr owned out by the giants.

Mark eters choose personal selling  when they need to make direct contact with the buyer . A salesperson can personalize your message to ﬁt the buyer’s needs and situation and can ﬁeld objections and questions in this interac tive process. This avenue is generally  the most expensive element in any mark eting mix because of the high cost of labor and commissions paid. Managers of products that are new, comple x, or expensive ﬁnd that the beneﬁts of personal selling often outweigh their high cost. Because some target mark ets are inaccessible by other media vehicles, personal selling is sometimes the only means to reach consumers. Water puriﬁcation systems, pharmaceuticals, copiers, and industrial products widely utilize personal selling in their mark eting mixes. The use of telemark eters has greatly been reduced by the adoption of many do -not-call lists. Current theory holds that personal selling is a problemsolving  and consultation  process. Professor Derek A. Newton of the Darden School at the University of Virginia saw personal selling as having evolved over the years in four stages: Music Man, Anim ated Catalog, Magic Formula, and Problem Solver. Befor e World War I it was believed that the “Music Man” approach to selling was the key to success. It was the salesperson’s personality that enabled him to charm his customer into buying. After World War I, the “Animated Catalog” was consider ed the right way to sell. Vacuum cleaner salespeople knew all the facts about their products, and their sales presentations were rehearsed catalog readings. During the 1930s the slick pitch or “Magic Formula” was thought to be the best sales approach. Encyclopedia sales reps would contr ol the presentation and lead the customer down  a “mapped- out road” to a “sure sale.” Many books currently on the bookstor e shelves claim they hold the “secr et” of how to close a sale.

Sales promotion is designed to elicit the desir ed behavior from the consumer, the sales force, and other channel participants. Sales promotions are designed to complement and reinforce other promotional eﬀorts, especially advertising. Each type of promotion has its own associated vocabulary that you should be awar e of. If you are not a mark eter, know ing the vocabulary does not make you an expert, but it can sure help you to engage in intelligent mark eting conversation, if need be. There are two types of promotions: those directed towar d the consumer, and those dir ected at the distribution channels. Consumer sales promotions  techn iques available are coupons, r efund oﬀers, samples, pr emiums, and contests. Coupons  are a direct way to pass a price reduction on to consumers. As a manufactur er, if you give retailers a discount in hopes that they will pass it along to consumers, you may be sadly disappointed. Mark eters use coupons to encourage trial, brand switching, and brand loyalty . Grocery coupons are most often placed in a special coupon section of the Sunday paper called freestanding inserts  (FSIs). The leader in FSIs is Valassis Inserts, which prints almost half of the 332 billion coupons distributed annually in Sunday FSIs. Coupons can also be distributed on a corporate Web site at little cost. Groupon, the social media coupon ing site, provides daily deals for a variety of services and pr oducts. Rebates  are also used for more expensive items, especially electr onics, to reduce their perceived cost to the consumer . Rebates requir e buyers to complete paperwork, retain receip ts, and mail them in. Because of the work involved, even rebates of $50 or more have low redemption', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ammar\\\\Downloads\\\\Steven A.

Mark eters need to estimate the redemption rate and net cost and include the net cost in their mark eting budgets. Refunds  are generally used to accelerate the normal consumer purchase cycles. Refunds are usually used to increase the quantity or frequency of purchase by encouraging buyers to stock up. Battery manu factur ers frequently use refund oﬀers. Such oﬀers have been cleverly used to stock up consumers just befor e a competitor’s promotion or pr oduct intr oduction. Samples  are a high-cost way of introducing a new product. Sampling requir es a cash investment to produce and stock the smaller -sized packages. Samples are properly used for products whose beneﬁts are “sensory in natur e” and cannot be communicated eﬀectively by advertising. Sampling may also be eﬀective for products that consumers would view as risky in switching to a new brand, or that may have a high probability of generating word of mouth  (WOM) activity after use. Many new shampoos use free or low-cost samples since their beneﬁts are sensory . Consu mers are reluctant to risk four dolla rs to try a whole bottle. Sampling reduces the buyer’s risk of trial. Premiums  are items oﬀered at low or no cost to purchasers of a product. Self-liquidating  premiums are those for which the price charged covers just costs. Hershey’s has periodically oﬀered watches and Christmas ornaments as premiums. T o get the goodies, chocolate lovers have to send in wrappers as pr oof of pur chase. Mr . Bubble, the happy pink bubble-bath man, is pictu red on inexpensive T-shirts, beach towels, and sweatshirts that ar e printed on every bo x. Contests and sweepstak es are a popul ar promotion  and the most restricted legally, because they border on gambling.

In 1984 McDonald’s ran a summer Olympics medal game. Every time the United States won, game pieces could be redeemed for free food and other prizes. When the Communist bloc boycotted the games, the United States won most of the medals, and most of the game pieces became winners. Trade-dir ected sales promotions  tools include sales contests, point- of-purchase displays, dealer incentives, trade shows, and in-stor e demonstrations. There are many variati ons on the point- of-purchase display  (POP). To get them in the stores requir es the cooperation of the trade. On the retail shelf a POP can be a shelf talker, a minibillboar d attached to the end of the shelf with a little ad used to attract attention. Freestand ing aisle displays and built-in shelf displays are other forms of POP. When a display is at the end of an aisle it is r eferred to as an end cap. To get those prime sports, the manufactur er must entice the retailer . A mark eter can do it by providi ng a high mark up per item or a high tur nover on lower -margin items. Dealer and employee incentives.  Payments made to dealers for mark eting support are called spiﬀs.  They can take the form of slotting fees, case discounts, cash payments, free merchandise, or prizes. Spiﬀs enable the dealer to discount, promote, or justif y carrying a product. A manufactur er can also give incentives to the dealer’s employees to place store displays or awar d prizes for meeting sales  targets. Trade shows  are a way to promote a new or existing product to the wholesalers, dealers, retailers, and distributors. This promotion tries to encourage the channel participants to carry your product.

Public relations (PR) is typically a promotional tool used to communicate to a broader audience. PR is intended to create a favorable climate for your product, not to directly sell it. The list of possible PR targets can include politicians as well as the communities in which a company operates. The PR message can be intended to create goodwill, correct a mistak en impression or factual situation, or to explain a ﬁrm’s actions. Sponsorship of prestigious or charitable events or causes is often used to create a halo eﬀect  of positive feeling towar d a corporation  and its products. Hallmark Cards’ sponsorship of television’s Hallmark Hall of Fame aligned itself and its products with the attributes of quality, cultur e, and good citizenship.

With the advent of the Internet, viral mark eting can quickly translate into direct measurable sales via links to commer cial W eb site stor es. Publicity,  a form of public relations, is any unpaid  form of mass media communication about a company or product. It can take the form of a news story or even the appe arance of a product in the media. Publicity is a two-edged sword. It is judged as more credible by the public because it is not purchased; however, there is less contr ol over the message. Press confer ences, press releases, use by celebrities, and staged events are used to captur e the media’s attention. Using a PR agency allows you to tap into their media contacts to captur e an audience and hopefully contr ol the impression made about your company or pr oducts.

Direct sales includes the realm of the Internet, junk mail, catalogs, shopping networks, and longformat TV infomer cials.  Direct sales are big business. Internet sales exceeded $165 billion in 2010 and are growing rapidly . In 2009 catalog sales were $110 billion. Over eight thousand ﬁrms mailed out 20 billion catalogs that year.

The more deﬁned, aﬄuent, and focused the list is on a desir ed demographic composition, the higher cost per thousand (CPM) names. The results are track ed by rate of return (ROR) and dollar amount per order. Because TV audiences lack a list’s selectivity, TV sales pitches cannot be as dir ectly tar geted as dir ect mail. Internet mark eting is the largest and a growing method of directly contacting the customer and receiving a direct response. In 2011 mark eters spent over $50 billion on Internet advertising. Search engine mark eting  (SEM)  or key word advertising  on Google’ s or Yahoo!’s Internet Web search engin es is purchased on a cost-per -click  (CPC) basis. You select your customer s by their interest when they are interested. In a competitive bidding process, the most sought-af ter word is priced at a mark et price.

Other Internet mark eting techniques include search engine optimization (SEO), bann er ads, pop-ups, social media ads, text messages, and e-mail solicitations to tar get your audience. The other component of both dir ect mail, Inter net, and TV selling is fulﬁllment.  Fulﬁllment is the process  of order entry, order processing, inventory management, mailing, and customer service.

It is argued that because corporations are so powerful, they have an obligation to assume social responsibilities.

Corporate leaders bear a ﬁduciary responsibility to all stak eholders. Flying in the face of the “politically correct” philosophy espoused at most institutions is a competing school of thought led by Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago . Friedman believes that business’s sole duty is to make proﬁts. “Businesses are in the business of maximizing shareholders’ value by a prudent use of scarce organizational resour ces, as long as the activities of the business are within the letter of the law.” In Friedman’s view, it is up to gover nment to deter mine what the laws should be.

Therefore, an executive at Similac is not equipped to make a moral judgment regarding the actions of the chief executive oﬃcer (CEO) of Nestlé, whose corporation was accused  of possibly selling harmful baby formula in developing countries. Role relativism  distinguishes between our private selves and our public roles. These public roles call for a “special” morality that we separate from the individual making the choices. The president of a ﬁshing company may personally dislik e the incidental killing of dolphins in his company’s tuna nets, but as an executive, he must not let his feelings interfer e with the best inter ests of the company . Social relativism  is akin to naive relativis m. People refer to social norms to render ethical judgments. “Industry practices,” “club rules,” “professional codes of conduct,” and “accepted practices” are the cop-outs of the social relativist. In the produce industry, it is “industry practice” to ignor e child labor laws and employ small childr en to work in the ﬁeld and miss school. Cultural relativism  holds that there is no universal moral code by which to judge another society’s moral and ethical standar ds. If a whole culture holds certain beliefs, how can an outsider sit in judgm ent? “When in Rome . . .” The concept of cultural relativism becomes more important as companies compete globally . Multinational corporations often follow local laws and customs that may violate ethical standar ds in their home countries. Discussions about apartheid revolved around issues of cultural relativism.

In the case of Donald Trump, the notorious real estate magnate of the 1980s, he may have owned billions of dollars of property, but temporarily his net worth reportedly became nega tive in 1990 as his debts became even larger than the value of his properties in New York City and Atlantic City. Owners’ equity is increased by conducting business. Businesses buy and sell and provide and receive services. Hopefully after a period of time, the company has increased its wealth with those activities. If the net assets increased over time, then it must have incr eased its OE. The OE captions on the balance sheet can be aﬀected in two ways. Investors can contribute more funds or they may elect that the company “retain ” its proﬁts. The line “retained earnings” is on the balanc e sheet for that purpose. If owners want to take out earnings, they may elect to receive dividends.  Dividends reduce their accumulated retained earnings.

At Bob’s Mark et gross margin was his sales less the cost of goods sold (COGS). COGS includes the cost of groceries and all costs “directly” related to making the groceries salable, such as the cost of shipment from the wholesaler . In a manufacturing company it includes the costs of production, materials, and labor . In a simple retail situation lik e Bob’s, COGS is calculated by this for mula: Beginning Inventory + New P urchases − Ending Inventory = Cost of Goods Sold  If a business has a negative gr oss margin, either costs ar e out of contr ol, or the pricing structur e of the industry does not aﬀor d the company a proﬁt. A small electr onics manufactur er would encounter this situation if it tried to compete with the Asian Blu-ray manufactur ers Sony, Samsung, and Sharp.

The next part of the income statement relates to the operating proﬁt of the comp any, the earnings befor e interest and taxes (EBIT). The further we move down the income statement, the more expenses that are deducted. At the operating level of proﬁt measur ement, all the other corporate expenses directly  related to the revenue process are deducted.

In Bob’s case, he spent $30,000 for shelves, carts, and cash registers. Because he estimated that they will last ten years, Bob’s income statement will show an expense of $3,000 ($30,000/10) each year to match and allocate  the cost of using those assets with the period of sales beneﬁted.

Below the operational  level of proﬁt, items not directly linked to operations are deducted to calculate income. The ﬁrst is the interest expense for the period. A case can be made that corporate borrowing is used to support the operation. However, the method of ﬁnancing the company is separate from the operating activit ies of the business. Accountants do not include interest in operating income, beca use companies in similar businesses may have been funded by using  diﬀering proportions of bank borrowing and investors’  money . Investors’ divid ends are not deducted . Owners pay dividends out of the net income at the bottom of the statement. If interest were to be included in operating income, similar comp anies could  have vastly diﬀering operating incomes just by the way they funded their cash needs. A company under a diﬀer ent management could fund all its cash needs by additional investments from its owners.

If the same company borrowed for all its needs, its operating income would be reduced by the interest expenses. By segregating interest expenses, the operating  income reﬂects only the costs of “operating” the company, rather than “ﬁnancing” it. Using the same logic that excluded interest from operating income, tax expenses are segregated to leave operating income free of nonoperating expenses. Diﬀer ent tax strategies can result in greatly diﬀer ent tax expenses. Because taxes are often the product of a skilled tax accountant’s pen instead of operating results, tax expenses are put below operating results as a separate deduction, leaving net income  as the ﬁnal measur e of income.

When he extended credit to his customers, it delayed his receipt of cash, thus “using” cash that the store could have been using for other purposes. This is also shown as a subtraction on the statement. Conversely, reductions in inventory, i.e., sales, would have increased Bob’s cash. If receivables had declined, i.e., customers’ payments, cash would have been generated. Point of Learning:  Increases in current assets use cash while decreases in cur rent assets pr oduce cash. Current liabilities changes have the opposite eﬀect on cash. In Bob’s case his vendors advanced him $80,000. When Bob ran up a large debt with his vendors and employees, this meant that credit was extended to him, which in turn freed his cash for other purposes. In a sense, cash was created. If Bob had reduced his liabilities, that would have meant that he had made payments to reduce his debts, reducing cash.

Absol ute numbers in a ﬁnancial statement in and of themselves often are of limited signiﬁcance . The real information can be found in an analysis of the r elationship of one number to another or of one company to anoth er in the same industry—using ratios. In the gr ocery game, pr oﬁts ar e usually low in relation to sales, so grocers must sell in large volume to make any real proﬁt. A jewelry store survives on slower -paced sales but higher proﬁts per item. That is why ratios are used to compar e perfor mances among companies within an industry and against a company’s own historical perfor mance. There are four major categories of ratios: Liquidity  measur es: How much is on hand that can be converted to cash to pay the bills? Capitalization  measur es: Is a company heavily bur dened with debt? Ar e its investors ﬁnancing the company? How is the company funding itself? Activity  measur es: How actively ar e the ﬁr m’s assets being deployed? (MBAs deploy assets, rather than just use them.)

In a proﬁtable company,  by using a higher level of debt, the return is much higher because a smaller amount appears in the denominator of the ratio.

If a company has a high level of debt and a small amount of equity, the return on equity (ROE)  can be tremendously aﬀected. That is called ﬁnancial leverage,  the term that I mentioned befor e in discussing capitalization ratios. To illustrate the point, Bob and his father could have decided to leave very little equity in the company in 2012. They could have taken all of the $30,000 of net income made in 2012 out of the company as dividends and borrowed for their futur e cash needs. If that had happened, the balance sheet would have reﬂected a long-ter m debt balance of $40,000 ($10,000 + $30,000) and only $15,000 ($45,000 − $30,000) in equity . The resulting debt to equity ratio would  increase from 7 percent to 28 percent, and the return on equity  would have increased from 67 percent to 200 percent ($30,000/$15,000). As shown, ratios can be greatly aﬀected by the ﬁnancial leverage used. The choice of a lower equity level can “leverage” the ROE to extremely high levels. ROE ratio is a widely accepted yardstick to measur e success. If management’s goal is to achieve a higher proﬁtability ratio through leverage, there is a risk cost. Higher debt levels requir e higher interest payments that a company may not be able to service if operations do poorly .

In addition to drawing causal chains, during this analytical step you try to understand  the cause s. Why do they exist? What envir onmental factors play a role? By asking these types of questions you can begin to confr ont which causes can be corrected through management action. If one problem is insur mountable, diﬀer ent solutions have to be tried. In the example above, ﬁring uncooperative people was an option for the vice president. Sensitivity training and interdepartmental discuss ions were other possibilit ies.

Mr. Houston is about to exercise his option to drill for oil on a promising parcel. Shou ld he drill? If he hits a gusher, there is an estimated $1,000,000 to be gained. When he investigated all of the alter natives, Mr . Houston made the following list: 1. Sam paid $20,000 for the drilling option. 2. Sam could lower his risks if he hired a geologist to perfor m seismic testing ($50,000). That would give him a better indication of success and lower his risk of wasting drilling costs. 3. Should he roll the dice and incur $200,000 in drilling costs without a seismic evaluation to guide him? 4. Sam consulted with oil experts. They believe Sam’s parcel has a 60 percent chance of having oil without the beneﬁt of any tests. 5. It has also been the experts’ experience that if seismic tests are positive for the oil, there is a 90 percent chance there is “some” oil. And conversely, there is a 10 percent chance of failur e. 6. If the seism ic tests are negative, Sam could still drill but with a 10 percent chance of success and a 90 percent chance of failur e. 7. Sam could decide not to drill at all.

Lawyers involved in wrongful death suits can use net pr esent value  techniques to value the total of an individual’s futur e earnings when consi dering a settlement.

There was a .005 chance of a $6,000,000 payday and .005 chance of $50,000 as shown by the table of values. If you multiply each of the dollar values by their individual probabilities in the second column, the EMV equals $1,000,000, the EMV we used befor e. Constructing a cumulative distribution function allows decision makers to arrive at the mean or EMV when  they are not certain what it is to begin with. Drawing a CDF is a method of combining a series of your judgments about the probability of the upper, middle, and lower bounds of an unknown outcome to arrive at an EMV to use for decision making. The CDF graph of ranges of outcomes resembles a big S. In the CDF, you see at a glance all the possible outcomes, not just static individual points. As shown by the following graph, Sam Houston believes that all his possible outcomes fall in the continuous “ range” of $0 to $6,000,000. The range of probabilities from 0 to 1.0 in the CDF is divided into fractiles,  or slices, using the brack et median technique.  The CDF above is divided in that way. To divide the CDF probability ranges into ﬁve fractiles, for example, one would take the .1, .3, .5, .7, and .9 fractiles. Each of those fractiles would represent the average of the “ranges of values,” 0 to .2, .2 to .4, .4 to .6, .6 to .8, and .8 to 1.0, respectively . The .5 fractile is the same  as the median, because half of the values are on either side of it. The median is not necessarily the same as the mean we used as the center of the normal distribution.

There are ﬁve more types of bonds of note: zero coupon bonds, consuls, convertible bonds, callable bonds, and junk bonds. A zero coupon bond  bears no interest, but pays a lump sum at maturity . Investors value the bond the same way as one that pays interest, but there are no interest payments to discount. A consul  or perpetuity  is a bond that never pays back the principal, but continues to pay interest forever. These bonds are unusual but they still are issued in the United Kingdom. The valuation technique is simple. The cash ﬂow or interest payment is divided by the discount rate. A hypothetical example: London Telephone agreed to issue a $100 consul that pays $8 each year forever. If investors require a 10 percent rate of r eturn, the value would be $80 ($8/.10) Sometimes a company adds an even more exciting provision called a conversion featur e to bonds. Convertible bonds  are convertible to common stock at a predeter mined conversion ratio.

Convertible bonds usually pay a lower interest rate than nonconvertible bonds, because they provide investors with an additional option. The fourth type of bond is a callable bond.  In some instances issuers want the option to buy back their bonds from the public if interest rates fall signiﬁcantly after the issue date. In 1981, large corporations sold bonds paying 15 to 20 percent interest per year, the prevailing mark et rates. As interest rates fell later, in the 1980s and 1990s, the corporations that had included a call provision  bought back their bonds at predeter mined prices and issued new ones in the early 1990s paying 7 to 8 percent and bought even more in the late 1990s and 2000s for new issues at 5 to 6 percent. Because call provisions limit unusually high rates of return, corpo rations have  to pay a higher interest rate for the privilege of calling back the bonds. The last classiﬁcation, a junk bond,  is a bond that has a high risk of default. Often their risk lies in that they may be subor dinated  to the claims of other bonds issued by a company . Junk bonds pay higher rates to investors, and most still pay their interest and principal on time. If the company does not have enough money to make payments on its borrowing, the subor dinated debt holders get paid last. Junk bonds have been around as long as there have  been bonds. During the Civil War the Confederacy issued risky bonds that could be termed junk bonds.

Using the CAPM equation, the requir ed rate for Caterpillar’s beta of 1.2 was 16.8 percent, the same as IBM’s at the time.

If an MBA miscalculates the ability of the company to maintain a dividend his or her job will be in r eal jeopar dy. There are ﬁve questions that astute MBAs ought to mull over as they formulate a policy that may directly aﬀect their careers. Can the company do a better job by investing its earnings back into the ﬁrm than investors could by investing elsewher e? If a company is growing and has many exciting investment opportunities, dividends should be small and earnings should be used internally. In 2004, Wal-Mart paid a $.52 dividend per share against $2.15 in earnings, a 24 percent payout ratio, but investors were happy because the company was busy investing in many new and proﬁtable stores. Its dividend yield  was 1 percent of the $54 stock price. In the case of Microsoft, investors were upset that Microsoft was amassing billions in cash that it couldn’t eﬀectively deploy as its sales growth slowed. Microsoft responded in 2003 with its ﬁrst annual dividend of $.16 per share. In 2004, Microsoft doubled the annual dividend to $.32 per share and declar ed a special onetime dividend of $3 a share or $32 billion total, the largest corporate dividend distribution in history . Who is your stockholder?  Do widows and orphans depend on your dividends for their incomes? This is the case with utility stocks, but not with start-up Inter net companies. What will stockholders’ reaction be to any changes in dividend payments?  Changes in dividend payments are a powerful signal to investors. Investors react violently to any cuts in dividends, since they signal that the company is in trouble. Increases are not such a big deal.

Such dividends usually range from 2 to 5 percent of shares owned. For example, if you owned one hundr ed shares, you would receive  two to ﬁve new shares. Investors end up with a greater number of shares, but since all shareholders receive the same percentage share dividend, their per centage ownership of the ﬁr m remains the same.

CPM is used for complicated production  projects that requir e the coordination of many tasks. An even more comple x form of CPM exists called PERT, Program Evaluation and Review Technique. However, today most businesspeople use PERT and CPM inter changeably . Using CPM, production managers arrange each task or activity  in sequential order and estimate the time needed to complete each one. Each time a task begins or is completed it is called an event.  The CPM chart displays graphically all the events of a project. This enables a production engineer to estimate and manage the time to complete  the job.

Every step of the process is an opportunity for increased eﬃciency; hence the term Total Quality Management  (TQM). He divided problems into two categories, “common causes” and “special causes.” Common causes are systemic problems, shared by many work ers, machines, or product types. Special causes are those problems that relate to individual work ers, machines, or material shipments. Deming, with the help of Juran and W.A. Shewhart, developed a tool for identif ying problems called statistical process contr ol (SPC). “It is unlikely that two parts, even when produced by the same operator on the same machine, would ever be identical. The issue, therefore, was distinguishing acceptable  variations from variations that could indicat e problems.”  Statistical probability provides a method of making that distinction. Production engineers make that distinction by studying the expected tolerance of each production task. For example, the ﬁlling machine at a Coca-Cola bottling plant does not pour exactly two liters into the two-liter jugs. The range of error is a few milliliters above or below two liters. Production engineers need to perfor m detailed studies to deter mine the usual amount of liquid squirted into each bottle. This exercise will result in a deter mination of the bell curve or statistical frequency distribution of ﬁlling quantities. If you remember the normal or bell curve discussion in the QA chapter, the range of variation that occurs 68 percent of the time was called one standar d deviation  or one sigma  from the expected quantity . Any production measur e outside a one-sigma-tolerance quality standar d would signal a production problem. If a production manager desir es, he or she can choose two- or three-sigma tolerances.

Using Demin g’s SPC, a ﬁlling-machine operator could take hourly batches of ten two-liter jugs oﬀ the assembly line. Using one-sigma tolerance, samples above two liters and ten milliliters would be above the upper contr ol limit (UCL). For those measuring below two liters, 1,990 milliliters would be below the lower contr ol limit (LCL). Measur ements outside the limits would signal a “special pr oblem,” meaning a feeding line is crimped or clogged. The process would be consider ed “out of contr ol,” and the operator would be instructed to take corrective action. If after the correction the next samples are within the ten-milliliter tolerance, the process is “in contr ol” and the machines are allowed to operate.

With that in mind, this chapter sticks to the basics. It does not dwell on complicated formulas and diﬃcult concepts that you would probably skip over, have no real use for, and forget in short or der anyway . Economics studies how society allocates the limited resour ces of the earth to the insatiable appetites of humans. Supply and demand are the forces at work. At what is referred to as equilibrium  (E), the mark et price allows the quantity supplied to equal the quantity demanded. Suppliers are willing to sell, and consumers are willing to buy. Supply equals demand for a price. That, in a nutshell, is the basis of all economic theory . For example, let’s take a look at the local pub, Porth Tavern, which brews its own beer, Duﬀ beer.

For example, in the 1990s the demand for Harley - Davidson motorcycles had the company’s factories operating at 100 percent of capacity . Harley contr olled 60 percent of the big-tick et, big-bik e mark et, and management was forced to decide how best to allocate limited production capacity to satisf y demand. They chose to produce several models for sale in the United States and abroad. As a result, Harley -Davidson incur red a signiﬁcant opportunity cost because the company decided not to devote its entire capacity to its most expensive and proﬁtable models for export to Japan. Had Harley tried to maximize short-ter m proﬁts, it would have risked alienating the domestic mark et of devoted bikers—the very group that helped create the Harley mystique that the Japanese are buying.

Companies are motivated to maximize total proﬁts by maximizing revenues and minimizing costs. If a business has the opportunity  to sell even a single additional unit at a proﬁt, it should produce it. The marginal revenue  (MR) from the sale should exceed the marginal cost  (MC) to pr oduce. Enterprises should contin ue to produce until their MR equals their MC. At that point of equilibrium the marginal proﬁt on the next unit sold will equal zero. No proﬁts are left on the table. Past that level, the marginal revenue of each additional unit sold decreases and the marginal cost increases. Experience tells us that the more units businesses try to push on the mark et, the less the mark et is willing to pay for these goods. The cost of producing one additional unit is minimal . But if there is no excess capacity and a company wants to produce more units, new work ers will need to be hired, new equipment purchase d, and a larger factory leased or built. Therefore, once a factory reaches capacity, the marginal cost of producing one additional unit increases beyond the cost of the last unit produced. In the case of a cattle rancher, Bud Montana, the marginal cost of adding a steer to the herd is minimal. Fences still have to be mended and the pastur e maintained. Since he is a rational  decision maker, Bud will add cattle to the point that the marginal revenue from the sale of an additional steer will cover these marginal costs of raising this steer (MR = MC). If the cost of raising one additional unit becomes higher than the current mark et price, then Bud Montana will stop adding steers to his her d.', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ammar\\\\Downloads\\\\Steven A.

When the price was lower ed, demand increased. Converse ly, if the price had been higher, demand would have fallen. Buyers’ responsiveness or sensitivity  to changes in price is called elasticity . Elasticity of demand is one of the few economic theories that my MBA alumni friends have reportedly used. Brand managers at Procter & Gamble, for example, want to know how a price change will aﬀect demand for their brand of soap. Production foremen at Ford Motor Company want to know how price chang es will aﬀect their production requir ements. If consumer s are sensitive to price changes, their demand is termed elastic.  Consider the fast-food junkies’ buying habit s at Taco Bell. In 1988, Taco Bell lowered its prices by introducing “value meals.” Consumers responded strongly by increasing their purchases. With tacos priced at ﬁfty-nine cents, only ﬁfty-nine cents stood in the way of having a third or fourt h helping. Competitors followed. Package deals at McDon ald’s gave permission to fencesitters to order the large fries, large Coke, and apple pie with their Big Macs at savings of twenty to ﬁfty cents over ordering each item separately . When consumers are not sensitive to prices, econ omists call their demand inelastic.  Their purchasing behavior does not change with price changes. Necessities such as medical services or cigar ettes fall into the inelastic category . When patients are in pain becau se of an appendicitis attack, they pay whateve r the surgeon wants. Hard-cor e nicotin e addicts accept cigar ette price incr eases in the same way .

Managers must analyze historical data and also try to sort out the nonprice inﬂuences that may have caused a demand change, such as weather and competition. Another important aspec t of elasticity is that it is not constant at all price levels. At diﬀer ent price levels elasticity may vary.

Those with unlimited cash tend to be more price inelastic and buy regardless of the price. That is why the elasticity of “quantity demanded” diﬀers from the elasticity of “total revenue.” The die-har d beef eaters who are willing to buy at higher prices  make up for the lost revenue of higher sales volumes. The same concept of elasticity of demand can be applied to the supply side of the economy, but in the opposite direction.

For example,  imagine that in 2011 you produced in your kitchen one pound of saltwater taﬀy worth $1. Then the following year, you made an identical pound of candy, now worth $1.04 due to inﬂation. “Nominally,” in “current” dollar terms in 2012, you produced 4 percent more value. But did you really? No. Your output was the same. Therefore, economists adjust nominal GNP numbers with a deﬂator to yield real GNP. With “real” ﬁgures analysts can measur e and compar e “real” gr owth in the economy . In addition to a GNP deﬂator, economists use two more measur es of inﬂation to gauge inﬂation’s impact on the economy . The consumer price index (CPI) measur es the price changes of a speciﬁcally deﬁned basket of consumer goods and services that people buy most often. This shopping basket or collection of goods is kept constant from year to year. The producer price index (PPI) measur es price changes of a collection of raw materials used most often by producers. The CPI index uses 1982–84 as its base years (1982–84 = 100). The PPI uses 1982  (1982 = 100). In 2010 the CPI was 224 and the PPI 184. That means that consumer prices in 2010 were 224 percent greater than they were in 1984 for identical goods. There are also two additional variations of GNP measur es called net national product  (NNP) and gross domestic product  (GDP). NNP considers the cost of using up machinery, factories, and equipment in production. In accounting, as I know you remember, they call that wasting of assets depreciation.  NNP is GNP less the depreciation on the ﬁx ed assets used in the economy . Gross domestic product  is the part of GNP that is produced within a country’s borders. It is an important statistic for economies heavily involved in trade. For example, Japan’s GNP includes proﬁts from Honda’s', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ammar\\\\Downloads\\\\Steven A.

Countries such as China, Japan, and Taiwan use exports as their engines for growth. The United States, by contrast, drags its economy with a yearly trade deﬁcit. As mentioned previously, the Keynesians’ main goal is full employment. A lowering in GNP is distressing since it means fewer  jobs. If the economy is operating at a level below full employment, then there is what is called a GNP gap. If the gover nment intervenes in the equation by increasing spending, the economy will be buoyed up and there will be a rise in employment to close the gap. Playing the devil’s advocate, a monetarist would argue that the measur es of the economy provided by gover nment statistics are not accurate. Absent from GNP are the under ground and unrecognized economies of crime, unreported earnings, and the output of mothers working at home.

Keynesian theorists favor gover nment spending to spur the economy because they believe in its positiv e impact. Spending by one person or by a gover nment provides income to another individual or company. The way that such spending ripples through the economy in a repetitive cycle of spending and income is called the multiplier eﬀect.  How the Congress and the president decide to spend money is called the gover nment’s ﬁscal policy . The Keynesia ns believe that a gover nment’s ﬁscal  policy can “prime the pump” of a slow economy . In 2009 members of Congr ess raced to start public works projects to boost the economy during the deep recession. Road construction involves the purchase of rock, cement, steel, equipment, and labor, and the people involved in this work spend their wages and proﬁts on food, housing, and clothes. This multiplies  throughout the community the eﬀect of the original gover nment spending. Let’s see the multiplier at work for $1,000,000 of those construction salaries. The work ers’ impact on the economy is dependent on their marginal pr opensity to consume  (MPC) or spend the money they earn. If construction work ers spent 80 percent of what they earned and saved 20 percent, they are said to have an MPC of .8. The higher the MPC, the greater the impact of their earnings on the economy . The eﬀect on the economy would be calculated as follows: The eﬀect of $1 million  of wages would result in $5 million ($1,000,000 × 5) of total spending in the economy .

The downwar d-sloping curve explaining this relationship is called the investment and spending curve (IS).

On December 19, 1980, interest rates reached an all-time high of 21 percent, and people ﬂocked to invest in money mark et funds.

Velocity is the speed at which money changes hands. It is obvious that if a dollar remains under the mattr ess, it has little value to the economy . Its velocity is zero. If that same dollar were to change hands many times—be spent by some and be income to others— the rate of economic growth would be increased. Nonetheless, monetarists  oddly believe that the velocity of money is constant.', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ammar\\\\Downloads\\\\Steven A.

Holding velocity constant makes the money supply the only deter minant of growth in the economy . Keynesians ﬁnd that proposition ludicr ous. At diﬀer ent points in time, based on prevailing fear or euphoria, Keynesians believe there are changes in velocity . In a depression, for instance, people try to save whatever they can because they fear the next paycheck may be their last. You might conclude from the equation that by setting the printing press on high speed, a gover nment could send an economy into a high-gr owth gear. That may be true. The nominal GNP could be driven to new heights, but adjusted for inﬂation, the real GNP might remain the same or fall as a result. Monetarists are most concer ned about changes in price levels or inﬂation. If money is devalued by price increases, the real value of the economy’s output is diminished. The trick is to have the wise men in Washington increase the money suppl y just the right amount so that there may be economic gr owth with litle inﬂation. Keynesians like a little inﬂation. That preference is supported by the resear ch of A. W. Phillips of the London School of Economics, who claimed that higher inﬂation is accompanied by lower unemployment. The relationship between inﬂation and employment is shown by a graph called the Phillips curve.  Monetarists  don’t buy it. They believe that an economy with lower inﬂation can also have low rates of unemployment. Historical data in the United States show that the Keynesian relationship does hold.

The Fed, as it is called, has three monetary tools at its disposal to r egulate the economy . Change the discount rate. Banks borrow money from the Federal Reserve at a discount  rate and loan it at higher rates to customers. If the discount rate is lower ed, the margin between the bank s’ loan rate and their cost from the Fed is higher . In turn, that encourages banks to make more loans to businesses and to consumers for homes, cars, and credit cards. Banks charge their best customers their lowest loan rate, called the prime rate. More loans increase the money supply in the economy and the multiplier eﬀect starts. After September 11, 2001, the Fed lower ed the rate to 1 percent to prevent a sever e recession under extraor dinary circumstances, and that was lower ed to zero after the 2008 ﬁnancial meltdown. Trade gover nment securities.  The Fed actually trades in gover nment securities in the ﬁnancial mark ets. It buys and sells the gover nment’s own Treasury bonds. These trading transactions are called open mark et operations.  When the Fed purchases gover nment securities from the public it places more money in the hands of the public who sold them; the money supply increases. This is called quantitative easing  (QE). In addition to the unprecedented lowering of rates to nearly zero, the Fed in 2008 through 2010 also bought over $2 trillion of gover nmental debt in an eﬀort to bring the United States out of recession. When investors buy gover nment securities sold by the Fed, money is drained from their pool of cash; the money supply decreases. Change the reserve requir ement of ﬁnancial instit utions. The Federal Reserve requires that ﬁnancial instituti ons, such as banks and brokers, keep a prescribed percentage of the cash deposit ed by customers on hand. This cash is called a reserve.

Nations theor etically should maximize the production of goods that they produce most eﬃciently because of availability of land, labor, or good weather . Even if a country is able to produce a product at an absolute lower cost relative to another nation, that nation should maximize the output of products that it produces more eﬃciently than other nations. Ricar do proposed that Portugal export wine to England and import wool from England even though both products are produced at absolutely lower costs in Portugal. The rationale is that Portugal is more eﬃcient at producing wine than wool and it has a limited productive capacity . Therefore its capacity is best utilized for wine, and thus wool should be imported from England.

If exchange rates change between the time of signing a contract and its settlement, anticipated proﬁts can be wiped out by currency ﬂuctuations. Imagine if a farmer wanted to sell one U.S. dollar’s worth of beef to Japan. At the 2011 exchange rate he would charge 80 yen, expecting a 5 percent proﬁt. But when he got paid, he might need 100 yen to buy the same one dollar, because of a rate change. Although  the yen payment would have remained constant at 80 yen, the currency ﬂuctuation would have caused a 25 percent loss in U.S. dollar buying power . Companies and individuals use the futur es and options mark ets to oﬀset or hedge  losses on this kind of currency transaction.

The grower could decide to sell at a lower price than the grocery store or to sell at the grocery’s price and make the additional pr oﬁt. If a business operates in areas closer to the raw materials, then the company is said to be backwar dly integrated.  International Paper, which owns its own forests and paper -manufacturing facilities, would be classiﬁed as being backwar dly integrated. You can see a company as either forwar dly or backwar dly integrated depending on the point in the value chain at which you view that company . If you consider the orchard owner primarily as a grower, then you might view his business as forwar dly integrated towar d the retailing end of the chain. If you believ ed that his main business was retailing fruit to the public, then you could say that his business is backwar dly integrated because he grows what he sells.

By achieving the lowest cost of production in an industry, a company can either reduce its prices or keep the increased proﬁts to invest in resear ch to deve lop new and better products.

These “lear ning” eﬃciencies can come fr om six sour ces: Labor Eﬃciency —Learning thr ough r epetition or automation. T remendous pr ogress has been made in factory automation by using r obots and computer -aided manufacturing (CAM). New P rocesses and Impr oved Methods —Less costly ways to do the same task  Product R edesign —Redesign to lower costs of materials and labor . If a computer is used to design the pr oduct, it is called computer -aided design (CAD). Product Standar dization —Decr easing the variations of a product’s components  Eﬃciencies of Scale —Doubling factory capacity does not cost twice as much. A dding machines or additional space is not as e xpensive as starting fr om scratch. Substitution —Using less e xpensive but adequate materials To be useful, the learning concept must be quantiﬁable. The learning curve,  sometimes called the experience curve, does just that. It was developed by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in the 1960s to attach numbers to economiesof-scale beneﬁts believed to exist. They found that each time the “cumulative” volume of production doubled, the cost of manufacturing fell by a constant and predictable percentage. For exampl e, a consultant’s investigation of a manufacturing task could identif y an “80 percent learning curve.” This means that for every doubling of accumulated production, the next unit produced would cost 80 percent of the ﬁrst unit, or 20 percent less. Computer spreadsheet models exist to perfor m the mathematics.

A ﬁrm wishing to maintain cost leadership will strive to produce more units than its competition. That way its production costs will be decr eased mor e quickly . The concept of “dumping ” products below cost is a tactic the Japanese have used in the electr onics industry while pursuing a cost leadership strategy . These forwar d-thinking companies sold video recorders at low prices, expecting to realize proﬁts as they increased production at a lower cost. Japanese manufactur ers calculated their proﬁts using a ﬁveyear rather than a one-year time horizon. Therefore, they planned losses for their ﬁrst year, so that lar ger pr oﬁts could be realized in years three and four. American competitors saw the industry as unattractive and plagued by irrational pricing, while the strategic-minded Japanese companies walked away with the mark et. As the older products matur ed, the Japanese used the proﬁts from their sale to develop new pr oducts lik e DVDs. As a produc t matur es in its product life cycle  and becomes widely adopted, as described in the marketing chapter, the curve becomes less useful. To double accumulated production would requir e tremendous increases in volume that are simply not realistic. Proﬁts are also likely to be low. In this situation, the remaining competitors have the chance to catch up, if they haven’t given up. Learning curves are not static. A new process or material may increase work er productivity and thus alter the curve. In the razor instance, a new curve may be at work at, say, “75 percent learning” because of a new assembling machine, instead of 80 percent as shown. That is called jumping to a new curve.

With services, a point of diﬀer entiation can be employee courtesy, availability, expertise, and location.

Antitrust laws forbid this behavior . But by judici ously signaling, companies can achieve the desir ed outcome without time behind bars. In the airline industry, signaling is commonplace.

It’s just lik e pok er. Six common types of legal  signals ar e: Price Movements —to signal intentions and to penalize unacceptable behavior  Prior Announcements —to threaten, to test competitors’ r esolve, and to avoid surprises. In the r etailing industry announcements that a strong company will “meet or beat any competitor’s price” sends a str ong signal of a company’s r esolve. A smaller and weak er competitor should pr obably not compete only on price. Media Discussions —to communicate your rationale for actions and to convey your thoughts to the competition. Because e xecutives of competing companies ar e bar red from communicating with each other dir ectly, they do it indirectly via the media. An Exx onMobil e xecutive, for example, could e xpress his weariness with fruitless price wars and his hope that “mark eting messages” would constitute the basis of competition. In this way, Chevr onTexaco and BP would be put on notice to observe Exx onMobil’s price climb and act accor dingly .

Can one trust the other to k eep quiet? THE PRISONER’S DILEMMA   In competitive situations such as prevail in the airline industry, this scenario is similar to two companies that maintain high prices, each trusting the other to do the same. It is always tempting to break this silent pact, because a price war could result in the elimination of the other carrier. If they decide to cooperate in this unstable arrangement, they ar e both caught in a prisoner’s dilemma. All forms of signaling will be doomed if a competitor acts “irrationally .” In that case, any attempt to call a competitive truce would go unhee ded because in an irrationally competitive mind, winning, rather than maximizing proﬁts, is the goal. Game theory  is the formal study of competitive interactions. It analyzes possible outcomes in situations wher e peopl e are trying to score points from each other, whether in bridge, politic s, war, or business. You do this by trying to anticipate the reactions of your competito r to your next move and then factoring that reaction into your actual decision.

Another popular assignment in 1990 was to focus on customer retention.  Bain & Co., the theory’s leading exponent, created an entire practice out of it. The goal of such an assignment is to ﬁgure out how to create loyal customers and retain them. To accomplish that, companies and consulta nts perfor m extensive consumer research to understand customer buying habits and satisfaction. Consultants examine the customer base to discover who the best customers are so that they can be singled out for special treatment.

Common law is the framework of laws and guidelines that has been developed based on prior case decisions and opinions. A court’s decision is called a holding.

Procedural laws gover n the way those rules and regulati ons are implemented or accessed within the system of justice, in an attempt to impose an order for using the system fairly and eﬃciently . When lawyers actually apply the law, they refer to the state and federal codes called statutes.  Statutory laws are the word-for-word substantive rules enacted by the state and federal legislatur es or gover nmental agencies. These laws include criminal law, tax law, and gove rnmental regulations. To investigate how those statutes were applied in actual case situations , a lawyer refers to the body of rulings or opinions  called case law. By combining statutes and opinions, a lawyer can make a case for his or her client in court following pr ocedural rules of the court. For the MBA, business transactions are important, thus you hear a great deal about the Unifor m Commer cial Code (UCC). This is a special body of law that combines  both the statutory and the case law for business purposes. It is a compr ehensive statute adopted by each state that covers the major areas of business transactions, including sales contracts and commer cial paper .

Discovery —Lawyers gather the requir ed information and witnesses befor e a trial during discovery . Each side is allowed to see the evidence held by the other side. Unlik e what you may have seen in the movies, there should be no surprises. 4. Pretrial Confer ence —Often held for federal civil cases, at this meeting lawyers and the judge try to organize and narrow the issues of the case to the most important ones to make the trial more eﬃcient. Often out-of-court settlements occur at this point. 5. Trial—The trial is proceedings befor e the court. If a jury is selected, the process of selection is called voir dire. The location of the trial is called the venue. The jury decides the factual disputes, and the judge interprets the law and instructs the jury. If the plaintiﬀ’s case has no merit, a summary judgment can be made by the judge, ending the case without further trial. 6. Jury Instruction by the Judge and the Verdict—The judge instructs the jury about the issues of law involved in its decision.

With the cash ﬂow you can maintain and increase your property portfolio and pay yourself . For a residential property the lease is a simple monthly payment contract. Commer cial property leases come in two types. In a gross lease  the tenant pays the rent and the owner pays all operating expenses other than utilities. In a triple net lease,  the tenant pays the r ent, tax es, insurance, utilities, and maintenance. With the lease payments there are three types of operating expenses. Operating expenses have a ﬁxed, a variable, and a planned  portion. Fixed expenses include taxes and insurance, which are often paid in large payments annually or quarterly . Variable  expenses include utility payments not assumed by the tenant, repairs, main tenance, and a provision for vacancies between tenants. In addition, planned  expenses are those with a longer useful life, such as a new r oof, fur nace, or e xterior siding or painting. A large part of your investment proﬁt is from the reduction of mortgage principal paid for by the renters. As the balance of the loan is paid, your equity increases as time passes, even if the pr operty’s value r emains the same. As discussed in the ﬁnance chapter, leverage increases the return on your investment. This is one of the few transactions in which the average person can be engaged in very leveraged transactions. Mortgages with 5 per cent down are leveraged  at a twenty -to-one ratio. At 20 percent down, your gains are leveraged  by a factor of ﬁve. That is why large returns are possible on a relatively small investment. As a property  increases in value, you can borrow against the equity and invest in more properties or take cash. In an era of rising property values, fortunes are created. In declining mark ets, investments can be wiped out. However, real estate is far more durable than a biotechnology stock. Unless the property has an extreme envir onmental problem,', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ammar\\\\Downloads\\\\Steven A.

Appreciation in property values come from inﬂation, supply and demand in the mark et, and the opportunities for other uses for the property . If a residential property has commer cial possibilities, it can become more valuable. That is called the property’s “highest and best use.” Real estate investing is a local business. Prices diﬀer greatly  by city, neighbor hood, and block. If you think that the value of the investment lies in ﬁxing up the property, then get competent appraisals of the ﬁx es requir ed. The deductibility of loan interest for tax purposes is a tax shelter provided to all property owners that subsidizes your purchase. As opposed to nondeductible credit-car d interest, the gover nment helps you by lowering your after-tax cost of borrowing. The U.S. gover nment also has programs from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Federal Housing Adminis tration (FHA), and the Veterans Administration (VA) that can help you obtain the ﬁnancing requir ed to buy pr operties. Tax depreciation is another way the gover nment subsidizes your purchase with a tax deduction. Tax depreciation for U.S. properties is 27.5 years for residential properties and 39 years for nonresidential. The value of the land must be subtracted from the cost of the property being depreciated. Check your property tax bill for the assessed value of the structur e and the total assessment. Use that ratio to multiply by your purchase price to estimate the depreciable portion of your investment. Proﬁts realized in real estate transactions can be rolled over into new property purchases without a tax on the proﬁts. It’s a unique asset in that way. In an IRS 1031 taxdefer red exchange, you are able to roll over your equity much the way you roll over the proﬁts of an individual retirement account into another IRA account.

In these exchanges you must roll the entire proceeds into “like-kind” property and not take any cash, debt relief, or other things of value out of the rollover transaction. There are several ways to evaluate properties. The capitalization rate method  is a simple  way to value an investment property . The value of the property equals the net income from the property (rent less operating expenses) divided by a capitalization rate. The capitalization rate is what investors e xpect to mak e on their investment based on the prevailing interest rates, appreciation, and the riskiness of the rents. A capitalizat ion (cap) rate in 2011 of 8 percent was a comm on goal. In the case of property that has a net income of $10,000, it would be valued at $125,000 using this method.  Of course if improvements can be made to improve the net income, the property may be more valuable under the new owner’s management. Another valuation is a thumbnail method of using a gross rent multiplier,  but it is fraught with inaccuracies. The most accurate valuation method is to complete a full NPV analysis of the cash ﬂows and expected appreciation, discounted at a rate that compensates you for the risk of ownership as explained in the ﬁnance chapter . Also the analysis should include some  variation analysis of key variables to test the robustness of the pr ojections.

Personal leadership coaches are the rage for corporate executives, and they cost hundr eds of dollars an hour for their advice. I discussed the theories of leadership in chapter 4, “Organizational Behavior,” but many MBA programs have created leadership courses so that their students can be leaders themselves and, down the road, become lar ge donors to their school. Being an eﬀective leader involves having the selfconﬁdence to make decisions, motivating others, and assuming responsibility for your actions. In a nutshell, to become an eﬀective leader you have to overcome your fears and anxieties. It goes beyond a week end of climbing ropes. Most of the fear and anxiety of business leaders is over losing contr ol. Other  fears that stem from this include the common fear of going insane, fear of embar rassing yourself in front of others, and fear of failur e. You create fear within yours elf, and only you can calm yourself to be eﬀective. “If you knew that you could handle anything that came your way, what would you possibly have to fear?” Therefore “all you have to do to diminish your fear is develop the trust in your ability to handle whatever comes your way.” This wisdom comes from Susan Jeﬀers, Ph.D., the author of Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway . “Whatever happens to me, given any situation, I can handle it.” But what about really horrible things? You may experience uncontr ollable events, but if you do your best, then you cannot ask for any mor e of yourself . Many things create the fear within you.

You may have lost a family member or had one incapacitated by disease or addiction. It sounds horrible, yes, but most families, mine included, have elements from the list that have formed our personalities, habits, and dispositions. They lead people to be perfectio nist, guilty, obsessive, nervous, sensitive, overreacting, overly concer ned about the opinions of others, and apparently in contr ol all the time. Many of these same traits have driven you to be successful as a student and as a businessperson, but at a point, they hold you back from being a gr eat leader . The ﬁrst step of improvement is to recognize that you have these fears and can conquer them. When you have this feeling of a loss of contr ol, which is the basic core fear, you accept it. The anxiet y is created by an external source in most professional situations. That creates an internal anxiety, such as nervous ness or a sweaty brow. It is your choice how you r eact. Don’t ﬁght the anxiety, understand it. When you deal with external events, your mind tends to create cognitive distortions of the real situation causing you needless anxiety .

Any decision that you make will not result in nuclear holocaust. Everyone survived the collapses of Enron, WorldCom, and Bernie Madoﬀ’s Ponzi scheme. Martha Stewart went to jail and she r ecover ed. After making  a decision, do not wed yourself to what you thought “should be” the outcome: throw away that pictur e. If things do not work out perfectly, accept responsibility and correct the situation. Avoid wasting your time trying to “protect” the righteousness of the decision that you made. You cannot change the past: you can only aﬀect the futur e. Feeling guilty  is not a productive treadmill to run on. Forgive others and yourself and be solution- oriented. If you are having negative thoughts, Basset suggests that you need to recognize the thoughts for what they are and raise the “stop sign” right there. Ask yourself if the thoughts are true, realistic, rational, and reasonable. Use your positive internal voice to put things into perspective and assur e yours elf that you can handle it, and make yourself feel positive.  Positive self-talk is better than a bad habit of negative talk. In a positiv e and powerful mental state, you solve the problem by doing,  not worrying.  If you are busy doing,  you are not busy worrying.  “Change your mind and change your mood.” The distraction of being active solving your problem, or perhaps  taking some time out to exercise, listen to some music, or do something else positive, will provide time for the initial anxiety to pass. That enables you to become a more positive and productive leader  for your next challenge. Many other experts have similar advice. Spencer Johnson’s The Present  is a great book about an old man’s sage advice about becoming happy as a result of focusing on action in “the present. ” “Be in the present, focus on what is right now. Use your purpose to respond to what is important to you. Learn from the past. Learn something valuable from it and do something diﬀer ent in the present.', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ammar\\\\Downloads\\\\Steven A.

Put your plan into action in the pr esent.” In Johnson’s Who Moved My Cheese?,  with examp les of mice and little people caught in a maze, he focused on taking action  in the face of a changing world. He advocated accepting change as part of life, proactively anticipating change, and dealing with it. Accepting change and dealing with it is more productive and better for your well-being than being paralyzed by fear and anxiety . Leadership coaches touch on the practical as well as the big life-planning issues. Tools that leadership coaches suggest include keeping organized and prioritized by creating daily to-do lists. The lists enable you to check things oﬀ during the day and feel productive, even though you are not solving every issue at your company . Don’t overschedule your day; it is a method of avoidance. To eﬀectively network and keep connected, you must keep an updated contact list. If you include signiﬁcant keywor ds with your entries, such as Masters  with someone whom you met at the Augusta golf classic, you can more eﬀectively ﬁnd people when you don’t r emember their names. On the big life issues, coaches will help you create a detailed set of goals for yourself : company, professional, personal, professional relationships, family relationships and community . Then you will review it periodically with the coach to make sure that you are on track and that your actions are in line with your goals.
